- Axe does not test hidden regions, such as inactive menus or modal windows
- Tags provide metadata about the rule. Each rule has one tag that indicates which WCAG version / level it belongs to, or if it doesn't it have the best-practice tag
- All rules have a cat.*(category) tag, which indicates what type of content it is part of
